# Using the Alabama Supercomputer Center For Windows Users

For Windows 7, 8 and 10 users, we recommend the freeware program PuTTY (https://putty.org)
to enable ssh connections to the Alabama Supercomputer Center (ASC). More info on how to
acquire and install PuTTY can be found in our [FAQ](http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/bioinformatics/bioinformatics-bootcamp-faqs.htm).
Alternatively, Microsoft has made available a Linux Subsystem that can be run natively within
Windows 10, thus allowing one to have a functioning Linux operating system on your personal
Windows 10 machine that can be used to connect to the ASC during the Bootcamp. Below are
the required steps for installation (but please note that installing this Linux Subsystem is
much more than what is needed for the Bootcamp):
1. Open Control Panel, then Programs, then Turn Windows Features On or Off.
2. Check the Windows Subsystem for Linux and click OK.
3. After installation, restart your system.
4. Open the Microsoft Store, search for Linux and click Get the Apps.
5. Select Ubuntu and click the Get button.
6. Once the installation is complete, you will find an “Ubuntu” entry in your Start Menu that
can be used to launch the Linux Subsystem.
For security reasons, the Alabama Supercomputer Center (ASC) will not let you log into any
account if your IP address is originating outside the state of Alabama. This could be a problem
once you leave the Bootcamp and try to connect to your student account on the ASC. To get
your computer added to this list you must be sitting at the computer you will be using, in the
place that you will be using it and visit http://ipv4.asc.edu/. Copy this information and send it to
hpc@asc.edu requesting that it be added to the whitelist for the AU Bioinformatics Bootcamp.
